This program is intended as a tracer round for the flow of control as 
a user of a social media account makes, deletes, and edits posts. For 
testing, a user should be able to enter their user name, change which 
user name they are currently using, add a post using their current user 
name, remove a post made under their current user name, edit a post 
made under their current user name, print the contents of the list of 
posts, or quit the program.
